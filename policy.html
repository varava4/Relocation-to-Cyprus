						protect our legitimate interests and for compliance with legal and financial regulatory obligations
						to which we are subject. When you use our services, you consent to the collection, storage, use,
						disclosure and other uses of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

						2. From third-party providers and services, such as credit reference agencies, fraud prevention
						agencies, identity verification vendors, banks, authentication service providers and public registers.<br>
						3. Or engaging with 3rd parties in order to facilitate the Clients’ enquiry, which is already under
						contractual obligation.

						● Voluntary information–when you communicate with us (for example when you send us an email
						or use a “contact us” form on our site) we collect the personal information you provided us with.<br>

						● Financial information – by its nature, your use of our services includes financial transactions, thus
						requiring us to obtain your financial details, which include, but are not limited to your payment
						details (such as bank account details and financial transactions performed through our services). This could be done before
						engaging with 3rd parties in order to facilitate a purchase or to prove that you have a sustainable amount of funds to
						support an extended visa, or for due diligence.<br>

						when you use our services, such as your IP address, MAC address, and device approximate location.<br>

					</p>
					<p class="policy__text text">
						In addition, we may merge the information we have with information collected through said tracking
						technologies with information we may obtain from other sources and, as a result, such information may
